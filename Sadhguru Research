Here is a suggested how-to guide for spiritual transformation based on the practices recommended by Sadhguru:

Establish a Daily Spiritual Practice
- Set aside time each morning and evening for spiritual practices. Start with 5-10 mins and increase up to 30-60 mins.

- Do Isha Kriya meditation for 12-18 mins daily. Follow the instructions for the 3 stages of breathing, chanting “Aaa”, and sitting in silence. 

- Practice 10-15 mins of yoga asanas focusing on breath awareness. Choose gentle poses to start.

- End your practice with 5 mins of silence, witnessing your thoughts/emotions without judgment. 

- Chant “Om Namah Shivaya” or “Shiva Shambho” mantras for a few minutes.

Deepen Self-Inquiry
- Journal for 10 mins daily. Explore questions like “Who am I?”, “What do I really want?” to understand your true nature. 

- Spend time in nature. Ask yourself “What is my role in the larger ecosystem?” Contemplate your insignificance before the cosmic vastness.

- Reflect on death and impermanence. How would you live if you had one year to live? 

- Observe but don’t identify with your thoughts, emotions. Witness but don’t get entangled in the inner chatter.

Nurture Devotion 
- Dedicate actions to the Divine or Higher Purpose. Chant “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” before working.

- Visit temples/spiritual places to experience expanded awareness.

- Listen to devotional music/sounds from nature daily. 

- Volunteer selflessly. Serve others expecting nothing in return.

Transform Habits and Thinking
- Eliminate complaining and blaming. Take responsibility for your inner state.

- Go on a 30-day media fast or satsang fast. Observe how habits and thinking shift.

- Practice non-hoarding. Donate or discard objects that no longer serve you. Let go of attachments.

- Focus on enhancing the quality of your life energy. Care for your body with yoga and nourishing foods.

By combining these practices over time, you can attain higher levels of perception and move closer to realizing your true essence beyond limitations. Be steady and patient with the process.

Based on the passages, Sadhguru recommends the following practices:

- Look inward and enhance perception rather than focus on external quests. Turning inward and becoming receptive allows one to perceive life in new ways. 

- Don't pursue ideas of God, enlightenment etc. Just open up perception and let things unfold. Don't go "spirituality shopping" too early.

- Become meditative by cutting through psychological processes and touching existence directly. Sit with a meditative master to receive the blast of energy that is true knowing. 

- Do sadhanas and kriyas that crank up one's energies to break limitations and touch the limitless. Kriyas strengthen the energy system and loosen karmic bonds.

- Practice devotion and use the power of fired up emotions to transport oneself to the borders of the unlimited. The path of devotion is the quickest way to spiritual growth.

- Do yoga practices like Shambhavi Mahamudra to attain blissful and intoxicated states while being fully conscious and alert.

- Perform bhuta shuddhi to cleanse the five elements in the body of all karmic memory and residue.

- Strengthen the energy system through practices like Shakti Chalana Kriya to prepare the foundation for higher possibilities.

- Distance oneself from the body and mind by disidentifying from them. This creates receptivity.

- Make thoughts and emotions less important, settle the mind, and cut through the psychological to allow meditativeness.

- Don't use imagination or interpret dreams during meditation. Remain open and choiceless.

- Do sadhanas to shed karmic memory and attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

The key according to Sadhguru is to raise one's energies and perception to touch the limitless, turning inward rather than seeking external quests. By doing the right sadhanas, one can break free of limitations and experience mystical states of bliss and intoxication.

Based on the passages, Sadhguru recommends several practices for transforming the mind and experiencing inner peace:

- Isha Kriya - A 12-18 minute guided meditation that involves focusing between the eyebrows, chanting mentally "I am not the body" and "I am not even the mind", chanting "Aaa" sounds, and sitting in stillness. He says doing this daily can create distance between one's sense of self and the mind, bringing clarity and inner peace. 

- Being involved with life while remaining unentangled - Being engaged in life activities and relationships fully, but without getting identified or attached to them. This allows one to experience life more profoundly.

- Looking at life experientially rather than logically - Using direct perception and experience of life rather than relying solely on intellectual analysis. This provides a clearer understanding of reality.

- Cultivating awareness - Developing the capacity to simply observe one's body, mind, emotions etc. rather than over-identifying with them. This creates space between one's sense of self and the churnings of the mind.

- Letting the mind become still - Not constantly engaging the mind in unnecessary thinking and activity. Allowing periods of just being, which leads to inner calmness.

- Seeing one's own stupidity - Developing humility by seeing the immense intelligence in all of life and existence, which makes one's own intellect seem limited. This reduces over-importance given to one's thoughts.

- Transcending the modifications of the mind - Going beyond the conditioned patterns and distortions created by the mind. This happens through practices like Isha Kriya. 

- Devotion - Developing a devotional attitude towards a deity, guru or ideal, where one wants to dissolve into it completely. Sadhguru says this can be very rapid means to realization, but cautions it may not be suitable for the modern intellect.

In essence, Sadhguru offers practical methods to create distance between one's sense of identity and the workings of the mind. This leads to liberation rather than control of the mind.

Based on the book, here are some key practices that Sadhguru recommends:

- Isha Kriya - A simple but powerful 12-18 minute guided meditation that creates distance between you and your thoughts/emotions. Helps one experience inner stillness and peace. 

- Shambhavi Mahamudra - An advanced kriya or inner energy process for deep inner transformation. Involves observing the breath and incorporating mantras/mudras.

- Cultivating inner pleasantness - Rather than seeking external fulfillment, focusing on becoming pleasant within through one's body, mind, emotions and energy. This attracts others.

- Living fully - Being involved in every aspect of life totally, without holding back. This means participating in external activities as well as inner spiritual practices.

Based on the passages, Sadhguru recommends several practices for developing and deepening relationships:

- Be loving and compassionate towards all people and things. Approach the world with an attitude of gratitude, seeing the uniqueness and value in everyone and everything. 

- Reduce your identification and attachment to your body, mind and emotions. Attachment to your own body leads to attachment and entanglement with other bodies. Practice being less identified with your sexuality and gender.

- Focus on enhancing who you are on all levels - physically, mentally, emotionally and energetically. When you become a more beautiful being, relationships will happen naturally.

- Do not try to manage or control other people. Seek to include others rather than exclude them. Let go of expectations and allow relationships to unfold with acceptance.

- Create relationships based on energy rather than only body, mind and emotion. Energy-based relationships can extend beyond a single lifetime. The guru-disciple relationship is emphasized in this regard. 

- Practice seeing from a non-discriminatory intelligence. Relate to all of existence - people, animals, nature - with equanimity and devotion. 

- Remind yourself of your smallness and insignificance in the face of the infinite cosmos. Checking your ego helps dissolve barriers between you and others.

- Engage in spiritual practices like yoga and meditation to become an "empty page" energetically. This allows your relationships to deepen beyond superficial levels.

The core emphasis is on working on yourself first before trying to manage external relationships. Growth of one's consciousness and energy is seen as the foundation for healthy, liberating relationships.

Based on the conversation with Sadhguru in this book, here are some key practices he recommends for achieving joy:

- Check your "joy accounts" every night - reflect on how many moments of joy you experienced that day and track whether this is increasing over time. This helps make joy a conscious priority.

- Do not create misery - if you stop fueling your own suffering, joy will arise naturally as your basic state of being. Don't get caught up in complaining or blaming external factors. 

- Bring awareness to the present moment - joy is only found in the here and now, not in chasing the past or future. Be present with the reality of each moment.

- Do inner work to connect with the source of joy within - techniques like yoga and meditation help you get in tune with the inner force of creation and joyfulness that resides within. This is the basis for lasting joy.

- Let go of identifications and accumulated impressions - joy gets obscured when you overly identify with possessions, titles, relationships etc. Allow the true essence of your being to shine through.

- Don't pursue joy, share it - joy is not something to be attained, but your natural state. From this space, you can give joyfully to others.

- Bring consciousness to your actions - operate from awareness rather than compulsiveness. Make joy the context for whatever you do.

The key according to Sadhguru seems to be shifting from unconsciousness to consciousness, from misery to inner joyfulness. Simple daily practices help anchor this inner transformation.

Based on the contents of the book, here are some key practices that Sadhguru recommends:

- Yoga and meditation - Sadhguru emphasizes yoga and meditation as ways to evolve one's energies and enhance perception. Through yoga and meditation practices, one can become more receptive and open to higher dimensions of life.

- Going beyond dualities - Shiva represents being beyond dualities like good/bad, beautiful/ugly, etc. Sadhguru encourages embracing life fully, neither attracted nor repelled by anything.

- Becoming an aghori - Sadhguru explains that being an aghori means embracing life totally without division. It means treating all beings and experiences equally without psychological resistance.

- Breaking limits - Sadhguru characterizes spiritual seekers as "outlaws" willing to break the laws set by nature for human beings. He invites people to join the "gang" of outsiders like Shiva who transcend limitations.

In essence, Sadhguru prescribes various yoga and meditation practices to activate inner energies and higher levels of perception. He encourages an attitude of openness, inclusiveness and going beyond dualities.
